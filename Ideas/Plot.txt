Scene 1:

	Idea 1:

		Starts out in a prison. Super dark and scary. There is a hole in the wall / key on the floor / etc. First challenge is super basic to tutorial the game to the user.

	Idea 2:

		Starts out in the middle of the action. Fighting a man at arms or something. Gotta kill him to proceed to the next stage.

	Idea 3: 

		Start out in Shreks swamp. The beginning of a great Memeventure.
