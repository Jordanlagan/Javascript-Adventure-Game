Scene 1:

	Idea 1:

		Starts out in a prison. Super dark and scary. There is a hole in the wall / key on the floor / etc. First challenge is super basic to tutorial the game to the user.

	Idea 2:

		Starts out in the middle of the action. Fighting a man at arms or something. Gotta kill him to proceed to the next stage.

	Idea 3: 

		Start out in Shreks swamp. The beginning of a great Memeventure.

	Idea 4:

		The adventure begins my friends in the apartment of a man named Kosula Ashieet, a friendly Sri Lankan man who walks heavily on the floorboards and smokes a shit-ton of week. One day, a young guy in his early twenties moved into his prayer room. He 
slept on a bedbug ridden mattress and worked for a school, making the daily commute from his bed to his chair, and back to his bed again promptly at 2. He will face a variety of very difficult choices, ranging from classics like:
	a) you find a gram of weed on the floor. Do you 
		1. smoke it down like a champ
		2. report it to the cops
		3. leave it and let your roomate die from an overdose (hell yeah)
